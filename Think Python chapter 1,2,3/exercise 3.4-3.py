>>> #A function object is a value you can assign to a variable or pass as an argument. For
#example, do_twice is a function that takes a function object as an argument and calls it twice:
#def do_twice(f):
#   f()
#   f()
# Hereâ€™s an example that uses do_twice to call a function named print_spam twice.
#  def print_spam():
#  print 'spam'
#  do_twice(print_spam)
#  1. Type this example into a script and test it.
#   2. Modify do_twice so that it takes two arguments, a function object and a value, and calls the
#   function twice, passing the value as an argument.
#   3. Write a more general version of print_spam, called print_twice, that takes a string as a
#    parameter and prints it twice.
#    4. Use the modified version of do_twice to call print_twice twice, passing 'spam' as an argument.
#   5. Define a new function called do_four that takes a function object and a value and calls the function four times, passing the value as a parameter. There should be only two statements in the body of this function, not four.
