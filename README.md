# Python

This is my python code repository

The document “Python exercise code” contains some Python codes that doesn't matters.

Other documents are the exercise codes of the book ‘ Think Pyhton’. This is a really nice book. I heard so mang excellent person recommend this book. So I learn Python based on this book.

# Chapter 1，2, 3

The contents in chapter 1，2，3 are easy, correspondingly the exercises are easy. So if you have some experiences in coding, you don't need cheak the code.
